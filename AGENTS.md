# Working in this repository

## Product and platform contract

- This is a Japanese consumer SNS sample named expo-hono-opentofu-starter, backed by an independently deployed Hono API. There is no organization feature.
- **主にiOS向けにUXを最適化するが、Androidでも全機能が動作する必要がある。** iOSの典型的なアプリとして、Native Tabs、Stack、標準の戻る操作、シート、設定フォーム、Dynamic Type、ダークモードを優先する。Androidでは同じ機能をMaterialのネイティブUIと戻る操作で提供する。
- Use universal `@expo/ui` first for settings and platform controls. Main social features use an X-style custom timeline/composer with React Native Reusables and Uniwind; navigation stays native. Isolate iOS-only imports in platform files and provide working Android equivalents. Every icon needs an Android source. Every enabled control must perform its advertised behavior.
- For intentionally custom UI, use the local React Native Reusables components with Uniwind; follow [docs/ui.md](docs/ui.md). Native controls keep their OS appearance. Custom UI uses the neutral light/dark tokens in `apps/mobile/global.css`; do not copy these tokens into a second JS palette.
- The sample must work without Google Cloud credentials using local PostgreSQL and Vercel Emulate. Posts and likes are server data; appearance and haptic preferences are device-local. Seed is development-only, idempotent and must preserve user-created data.
- Use functional Japanese labels without punctuation in headings. Do not invent a brand or accent color. Use official Apple/Google login artwork, native symbols with Android sources, scalable text and minimum 48pt/dp custom touch targets. Separate account information from navigation/actions.
- Inspect the actual native screen after UI changes. Keep safe-area and keyboard insets in loading/error/empty states too. Like mutations use TanStack Query optimistic cache updates scoped to the post, with rollback and stable references for unchanged rows; never refetch the whole feed or disable all rows for one like. Profile is a user object with its own summary/actions and post collection. Mutations must not enable pull-to-refresh; only a user pull controls that animation. Sheets start at a content-appropriate detent.
- For mobile UI changes, review the full affected screen on iOS and Android, including empty and first-load states. Give recognizable actions matching SF Symbols and Android Material icons, preserve labels for ambiguous actions, and check that icons don't create duplicate announcements or tap targets.
- In list states, keep the surrounding navigation and any loaded header. Give empty/error content readable horizontal insets, a heading and a meaningful next action when one exists. Use content-shaped skeletons for initial list loads. Capture each affected state for the PR and check the image for alignment, safe areas, clipping and reachability. Fix visible layout problems on the affected screen before handing it back. Use [the native state checks](docs/testing.md#投稿一覧の状態を端末で確認する).
- Decision history: [Expo技術選定検討](chatgpt-conversation://6aec01ec-6938-83e8-94df-24f41ae3ad55). Record implementation decisions and differences in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Boundaries

- `apps/mobile/src/app`: Expo Router routes/layouts only. No Expo API Routes. Keep UI and hooks outside `app`.
- `apps/api`: Hono, Better Auth, Drizzle and Google Cloud. Node.js runtime; Bun package manager and server tests.
- `packages/shared`: Zod schemas and pure functions. Runtime code may import Zod and files within the shared package; only tests may import `bun:test`. No native modules, DB clients, secrets or server environment access.
- Mobile may import **only the type** `AppType` from `@starter/api/contract`. Use Hono RPC; never import server runtime code or duplicate API response types.
- Validate external input with Zod. Better Auth authenticates; protected Hono routes authorize. Store sessions with `expo-secure-store` through `@better-auth/expo`.
- Strict TypeScript: no `any`, unsafe casts or unhandled promises. Reuse library features and existing boundaries; no speculative services or wrappers.

## Issue → branch → PR

- Start every implementation, fix, or documentation/harness change with a GitHub Issue. Read-only investigation may come first; creating the working branch, editing files, and installing dependencies must follow Issue creation or confirmation of an existing Issue.
- Read `github-issue-pr-ops`, check existing Issues/PRs to avoid duplicates, record the goal, acceptance criteria and validation plan, and assign yourself before implementation. Incorporate scope changes into that Issue before continuing dependent work.
- Use **1 implementation Issue → 1 `codex/<issue>-<topic>` branch → 1 PR**. Link the branch to the Issue with `gh issue develop` and reference that Issue in commits and the PR. Keep unrelated work separate.
- Name each implementation worktree directory `expo-hono-opentofu-starter-<issue>-<topic>`, using the same readable topic as its branch. For example, branch `codex/123-add-something` uses directory `expo-hono-opentofu-starter-123-add-something` and API URL `https://api.expo-hono-opentofu-starter-123-add-something.localhost`. Keep directory basenames unique on the host and use only lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, starting and ending with a letter or digit, within 63 characters. Compose uses the directory basename as its project name; identical basenames share containers, networks and volumes even under different parents. Do not generate hashes or branch prefixes for project names.
- An implementation request includes completing this workflow: implement, validate, commit, push and create or update a Draft PR. Do not stop at local edits or ask again whether to create the Issue/PR.
- Keep the PR description aligned with the final diff and latest tested SHA, include evidence and remaining blockers, and use `Closes #<issue>` for the corresponding implementation Issue. Report the Issue and PR links when handing back the work.
- Mark ready or merge only within the user's authorization, after required checks pass. Respect branch protection, and confirm the PR/Issue state after merging; creating a PR is not evidence that it has merged.

## Skills and harness

- Read `.agents/skills/expo-overview/SKILL.md` first for Expo work, then the relevant `expo-ui`, `expo-router`, `expo-native-ui`, `expo-data-fetching`, `eas-workflows` or `eas-update` skill.
- Use `minimum-impl` for code changes, `github-issue-pr-ops` for Issue/PR work and `conventional-commit` for commits. Repository commitlint requires Conventional Commits, with no mandatory Gitmoji or Issue number.
- Verify APIs against installed SDK 58 types and versioned Expo docs. Install native dependencies with `bunx expo install` from `apps/mobile`.
- Add Reusables components from the **Uniwind** registry through the existing `components.json`. Keep source under `apps/mobile/src/components/ui`; preserve its upstream license and adapt it to strict types, scalable text and 48pt/dp native touch targets. Add only dependencies used by the selected components.
- `.codex/config.toml` configures Expo MCP; authenticate with `codex mcp login expo`. Never commit credentials or machine-specific settings.
- Preserve vendored `.agents/skills` and `skills-lock.json`; do not modify them incidentally.

## Development and validation

- Follow [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md). Local servers require Docker Compose and host Portless 0.16.0 (Node.js 24+). The Linux Dev Container is an optional editor/check environment. Mac/Xcode/Android Studio are optional; use Expo Go or EAS builds for iPhone checks.
- Run `sh scripts/worktree-init.sh` to generate mount paths before Compose; `setup` creates missing app env files without overwriting values. Host `bun run dev` wraps `portless compose up --build api metro`. Compose installs dependencies and migrates the isolated DB before API startup; Metro can start alone. Use the shared HTTPS/443 proxy and trust its local CA on the host. Internal API/Metro ports are 8080/8081, Portless assigns loopback host ports, and PostgreSQL stays unpublished. Use `portless compose --profile '*' down` / `services:down` to remove routes and retain volumes. Do not recreate API/Metro with plain `docker compose up`.
- For Simulator/Emulator development, run `dev:devices` on the host and use a Development Build. The generated `.env.devices` and `compose.devices.yaml` use the same HTTPS .localhost origins as the host while internal service addresses stay unchanged. Install the public Portless CA on each virtual device and merge generated names into Android emulator hosts. Only Android debug builds trust user CAs for .localhost. Run `devices` on the same host as Xcode/Android SDK; on Windows, Compose runs in WSL2 while Hub/ADB run on Windows. Use serial-specific ADB forwarding to the shared HTTPS proxy; remove it only when no worktree on that device uses it. Never commit generated origins or run Device Hub in Metro's container.
- Dev Container starts only the `workspace` editor and its setup/DB dependencies. Run Portless commands on the host; no Docker socket is mounted in the editor. Initial hook installation must be serialized across worktrees because Git hooks are shared; automatic Compose installs skip lifecycle scripts.
- `bun run check`: formatting, type-aware lint, strict typecheck, Bun/Jest tests and Fallow. `bun run test:integration` requires a migrated PostgreSQL database.
- `bun run doctor` and `bun run export:mobile` check Expo dependencies and bundle iOS/Android.
- After changing Uniwind configuration, run `bun run --cwd apps/mobile styles:generate` and commit `uniwind-types.d.ts` with the configuration. Do not edit or format this generated file. The persisted appearance setting drives `Uniwind.setTheme`; do not add a second theme store or competing `Appearance.setColorScheme` calls.
- `tofu fmt -check -recursive infra`, `tofu -chdir=infra init -backend=false`, `tofu -chdir=infra validate`, `tflint --chdir=infra`: credential-free IaC checks. Also validate `infra/bootstrap`.
- Use the lowest sufficient test layer: Bun for server/pure logic, Jest + jest-expo + Testing Library for mobile, Maestro for final native flows. No Vitest or Storybook.
- Keep database-free Bun tests in `*.test.ts` and API tests that need real PostgreSQL in `*.integration.test.ts`. Let the runners discover new files. Add representative allow/deny fixtures when changing a workspace import boundary.
- Exercise loading/error/empty/content states, failure recovery, keyboard access, large text, dark mode, back and sheet dismissal. Bundling is not proof of native runtime behavior; report device checks that could not run.
- Before finishing, run relevant checks, inspect the diff for secrets/generated files, update operational docs and report tested results plus remaining blockers.

## Delivery

- Regular CI needs no GCP or Expo secrets. Deployments are gated until account setup in `docs/setup.md` is complete.
- GCP uses ADC locally and Workload Identity Federation in CI, never long-lived service-account JSON keys. OpenTofu owns resources; Drizzle owns DB schema; CI owns app revisions.
- Build the API image before creating Google Cloud credentials and exclude generated credentials from Docker contexts. Promote the revision bound to the candidate URL only after its image and readiness are verified.
- Keep migrations compatible with the running API. Migrate before switching traffic; publish production Expo Update only after API readiness succeeds.
- Native dependency/config changes require a compatible new build. Use fingerprint runtime versions; never force incompatible OTA updates.
- Do not apply infrastructure, delete persistent data, submit to stores or change production traffic merely to make a check pass.
